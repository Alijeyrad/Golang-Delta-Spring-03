# Golang Delta Bootcamp Spring 1403


**Algorithms, Data Structures & Golang Scripting:**

  * Basic algorithms: Searching (linear, binary), Sorting (bubble, selection, merge), Recursion
  * Data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees (Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables)
  * Golang fundamentals: Variables, data types, control flow, functions, pointers, error handling
  * Golang concurrency: Goroutines, channels, mutexes, wait groups
  * Working with Golang libraries: standard library packages (e.g., fmt, math, strings)

**Software Engineering Principles & Concepts:**

  * Version control with Git: Branching, merging, conflict resolution
  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
  * Design Patterns: Common solutions to recurring problems
  * Testing methodologies: Unit testing, integration testing
  * Clean code practices: Readability, maintainability
  * Agile development methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban)
  * Software design principles: SOLID principles
  * System architecture concepts: Microservices, scalability

**Web Development Concepts & Frameworks:**

  * HTTP protocol: Requests, responses, methods (GET, POST, etc.)
  * HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
  * Building web applications with Golang biult-in libraries (net/http, etc.)
  * Building web applications with Golang frameworks (e.g., Echo, Gin)
  * API Consumption (Front-end)
  * RESTful API design principles
  * User authentication and authorization
  * Web security best practices

**Additional Tools:**

  * Docker: Containerization for development and deployment
  * Databases: Relational (SQL) vs. NoSQL databases, querying with Golang (e.g., SQL databases with GORM library)
  * Servers: Understanding different server types (web servers, application servers)
  * Cloud platforms: Introduction to cloud computing concepts (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
  * CI/CD pipelines: Continuous integration and continuous delivery for automation

**Daily Topics:**

* **Review key concepts:** Briefly revisit a concept covered in the previous lesson.
* **Coding challenges:** Present small coding exercises related to the day's topic.
* **Code review sessions:** Have students share their code and get feedback from peers and mentors.
* **Project discussions:** Dedicate time for students to discuss project ideas and challenges.
* **Industry trends and discussions:** Share current news or trends in the software engineering world, especially related to Golang.
